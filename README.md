# Chess Maven Queen Gambits Challenge
Analysis of the Chess dataset for maven [Queen Gambits Challenge](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/blog/queens-gambit-challenge) 

I know the instructions state the use of Excel, PowerBi or SQL. But i was more comfortable using Python and pandas with a littel help from matplotlib.

These are the insights i was able to gain from the dataset.

   The player that starts first(White player) has a higher chance of winning (49.86%)

   But it can be seen that regardless of the starting position most higher rated players 
   usually win with a (64.64%) win rate.
   
   More than (87.10%) were won as opposed to a draw or runninig out of time and the most common outcome 
   with 55.57% of the total games won by resignation and 64.32 % of those games were won by higher rated players.

   The Player with the most wins was Taranga winning 72 games in total(white and black) and he was the higher rated in only 50% of      the games,and surprisingly won more games when he started as black 52% more.	 
   
   There was a total of 124 openning moves but the Sicilian Defence, French defense, and Queen's Pawn game were the most used constituting 26.3% of all the games both won and drawn
